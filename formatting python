The steps are, in your terminal:
Activate your environment you want black to be installed in, eg. conda activate <env_name> (eg. “nf_base”)
For .py script files: pip install black
For jupyter notebooks: pip install 'black[jupyter]'
To maybe keep some of your own formattings you find more readable I’d suggest to duplicate your file
Execution: black <filename>.py or black <filename>.ipynb

And this again are the pep8 guidelines black refers to:
