# sometimes the jupyter-notebook does not take into account the conda environment, leading to import error
# you can see this by running import sys print(sys.executable) from both the terminal and the jupyter-notebook
# if they don't show the same path, with the environment included,
# you can directly create a new kernel to use in jupyter-notebook

# run this in the terminal
pip install ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name <kernel_name> --display-name "<Name_to_display>"
# don't forget to change <kernel_name> and <Name_to_display> by the conda environment name

# Finally, in jupyter-notebook, select Kernel>Change kernel><kernel_name>
